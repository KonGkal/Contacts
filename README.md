# Contacts
An app that lets you store and search Contacts.

This was a coding assignment, part of the admission process 
for a coding bootcamp.
My idea for the project was to use an array to store
all the data (as they wouldnt have to be stored permanently) that the users would submit.
I decided to use a class which will create Contacts (object instances)
and then i would push those objects in the array.
I would then manipulate the array to search, display and delete the objects.
I used getters to get the values of the object keys.
